  <h5>Research Management Made Easy.</h5>
  <p class="py-5 fs-1" style="line-height:30px; padding-top:15% !important; font-size:18px">Welcome to the Researchly platform! Researchly provides a robust platform for university research groups to manage the progress of their various projects. 
    Researchly was born out of a desire to overhaul the typical relationship between research groups and the applications that they use. 
    Unlike other platforms, Researchly is directly targets university research by taking advantage of the project flow common amongst research groups, allowing us to deliver a clutter-free approach to tracking deliverable progress and managing project tasks.
