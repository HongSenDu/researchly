Feature: allow users to leave a group

    As an existing researchly user with group memberships
    so I can better manage my research group

Scenario: User leaves group
    Given I am logged in
    Given I am a group member
    When I leave a group
    Then I should see a left group message
    When I return to the site
    Then I should no longer be a part of group
